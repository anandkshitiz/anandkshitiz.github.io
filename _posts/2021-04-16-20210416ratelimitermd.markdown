## API Rate Limiter - Overview

Rate limiting is an API's configured(and often agreed upon) behaviour to reject sender's request in case the number of request over a window of time crosses the threshold.

Example : An API which generates an authentication token can cap the maximum number of token generation request sent by a specific client(or/and from a specific ip address) in a period of 1 hour. Let's say 1200 request/hour.

In terms of rate-limiting, following scenarios can take place when a sender sends a request to a REST API
1. Rate Limit not reached : In this case, the API sends a valid response(2xx, 5xx etc.) as per the request. Additionally, API can also send few headers which provide information about the current status of rate-limit like :

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Rate-Limit-Limit: 1200
X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: 100
X-Rate-Limit-Reset: 1618728633175
```
2. Rate Limit reached : In this case, the API sends a 429 HTTP Code(Too Many Request). Additionally, API can also provide information about when this limit will be reset in the header.

```
HTTP/1.1 429
Date: Sun, 18 April 2018 21:33:25 GMT
X-Rate-Limit-Limit: 1200
X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: 0
X-Rate-Limit-Reset: 1618728633175
```
