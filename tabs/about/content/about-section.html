    <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.8;">
      I am a Backend Software Engineer with over 11 years of experience in developing complex and large-scale
      enterprise applications. I specialize in designing and building highly scalable, available, secure, and
      fault-tolerant systems from the ground up. My expertise includes writing clean, efficient, and responsive code in
      multiple programming languages such as Java, Kotlin, Python, and JavaScript. I am a strong advocate for leveraging
      GenAI, Machine Learning, and Data Science to address real-world and software engineering challenges. My approach
      is characterized by diligence, transparency, and a commitment to leading and mentoring teams with a positive
      attitude while solving complex problems.
