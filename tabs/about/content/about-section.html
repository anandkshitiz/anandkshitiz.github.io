    <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.8;">
      I am a software professional with 10 years of experience in building complex and large scale enterprise applications. I have
      designed and developed highly scalable, available, secured and fault-tolerant applications from scratch. I write
      clean and responsive code using a variety of programming languages like Java, Python, C++, JavaScript, etc. I
      spearheaded the design and implementation of a DevOps process from inception, which is now in use by a team of
      over 80 developers. I am diligent, transparent, and have a positive attitude to accept and solve complex
      challenges. Currently, I am working as a Staff Software Engineer in Intuit A2D team where I am focused to enable FGAC
      (Fine Grained Access Control) within Intuit Datalake.
